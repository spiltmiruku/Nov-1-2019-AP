# Project Summary

In this project, we'll provide a variety of JavaScript problems to help improve your skills. We would like you to push yourselves as much as possible. We expect you to at least finish two problems in each section. 

If you would like to push yourself further, try to complete every problem. Otherwise, feel free to move on to other content.

## Setup

* `Fork` this repository.
* `Clone` your fork.
* Open `./index.html` with your browser.

`./index.html` will provide links to all the spec runners for your convenience. It also has all the JavaSript files you will be working in imported into it. This will allow you to use the browser debugger for all your code in one spot.

## Tips and Tricks

One of the biggest tools at the developer's disposal is the browser's built-in debugger. To use it, open `./index.html` with your browser. Another great tool for small and isolated pieces of code is <a href="http://www.pythontutor.com/visualize.html#">Python Tutor</a>. Just make sure to change the code to `JavaScript ES6`.

<summary> <code> Destructuring </code> </summary>

```js
// Destructuring is a short hand way to access properties as an object and store them as usable variables.
// Consider the following object:

let user = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 33,
  appearance: {
    hairColor: 'Blonde',
    eyeColor: 'Hazel',
    height: {
      onTinder: '6ft. 4in.',
      offTinder: '6ft. 2in.'
    }
  }
}

// Accessing properties off this object might look something like this

let userName = user.name; // 'John'
let userAge = user.age; // 33
let userHairColor = user.appearance.hairColor; // 'Blonde'
let userEyeColor = user.sppearance.eyeColor; // 'Hazel'

// Or, using object destructuring

let { name, age } = user;

// notice here that we have to declare a new destructured object.
// That's because we're pulling values off two separate objects,
// even though they're on the same parent object.

let { hairColor, eyeColor } = user.appearance;

// Destructuring is a shorter, more concise way to access the properties from objects.
// -------------------------

// You can also destructure functional parameters that are objects,
// capturing only the object properties we care about.

let user = {
  name: 'Steven',
  age: 26
}

function greeting(user) {
  return 'Hello ' + user.name;
}

// Or, with destructuring

function greeting({ name }) {
  return 'Hello ' + name;
}

greeting(user); // 'Hello Steven';

```
